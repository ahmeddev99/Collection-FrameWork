	  --> Java LinkedList class can contain dup;icate elements.
	  
	  --> Java LinkedList class maintains insertion order.
	  
	  --> The LinkedList class implements Queue and Deque interface. therefore, it can also be used as a Queue, Deque or Stack.
	  
	  --> Java LinkedList is not thread-safe. You must explicitly synchronize concurrent modifications to the LinkedList in a multi-threaded environment.

	  -- know that linkedlist and arraylist both classes implements list interface
	
	       _____ARRAYLIST_____
	  -- ArrayList -- internally uses arrays to store the data --it means that arraylist is an index based data structure backed by array
	  
	  
	
		 _____LINKEDLIST_____
	  -- LinkedList -- internally uses doubly linked list to store the data elements
	  
	  -- Insertion addition or removal operations are faster in LinkedList because there is no shifting required
