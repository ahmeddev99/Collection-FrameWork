	 Deque interface extends the Queue interface. In Deque, we can remove and add the elements from both the side. 
	 Deque stands for a double-ended queue which enables us to perform the operations at both the ends.
	 Deque can be instantiated as:
	 Deque d = new ArrayDeque();  
	 Methods:
	 Element()--> retrive peek element
	 Peek()--> retrive peek element
	 Remove()--> delete peek (as per fifo)
	 Poll()--> delete last element
