	#Queue Interface
	
	Queue interface maintains the first-in-first-out order. (FIFO)
	It can be defined as an ordered list that is used to hold the elements which are about to be processed. 
	linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
	 A good example of queue is any queue of customers in a bank for a service where the customer that came first is served first.
	Deque Interface:
	Deque interface extends the Queue interface. In Deque, we can remove and add the elements from both the side. 
	Deque stands for a double-ended queue which enables us to perform the operations at both the ends.
	DeQueue=Double Ended Queue
	PriorityQueue:
	PriorityQueue class implements the Queue interface
	holds the elements or objects which are to be processed by their priorities
	PriorityQueue doesn't allow null values to be stored in the queue
